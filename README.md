1. Executive Summary
The "AI Pioneers" project is a strategic initiative by DYCSI to accelerate and facilitate the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies throughout the organization. Led by the AI Consultant Interns team and under the direct supervision of our CEO, the project will use an innovative, data-driven approach to identify a select group of collaborators. These "Pioneers" will be influential, charismatic, and proactive individuals who will act as change agents, training and motivating their colleagues in the use of new AI tools. The project will be conducted through a company-wide survey and the application of a Machine Learning (Logistic Regression) selection model to ensure an objective and effective process.

2. Problem Statement
The implementation of new technologies, especially AI, often faces a cultural and human barrier rather than a technical one. Resistance to change, lack of knowledge, or fear of complexity can hinder adoption and limit the return on investment. A purely top-down approach (from management to employees) is not always sufficient.

To overcome this challenge, we need an internal, peer-led movement that builds trust, demonstrates the value of AI in practical ways, and fosters a culture of curiosity and innovation from within.

3. Project Objectives
Primary Objective:

Identify and select a group of 5 to 10 employees ("AI Pioneers") who possess the ideal profile to lead AI adoption at DYCSI.

Secondary Objectives:

Develop a scalable and reusable selection model for future change initiatives.

Measure the current level of openness and enthusiasm for AI within the company.

Generate a positive and expectant environment around the implementation of new technologies.

Validate the use of Machine Learning in internal HR and change management processes.

4. Methodology and Phases
The project will be implemented in four key phases:

Phase 1: Survey Design and Creation

Tool: Google Forms will be used to facilitate the creation, distribution, and automatic collection of data in a spreadsheet.

Content: A survey will be designed with 5 to 7 concise questions, aimed at indirectly measuring the desired qualities. The questions will combine different formats:

Likert Scale (1-5): To measure self-perception of initiative, openness to change, and comfort with technology.

Multiple Choice: To understand how they prefer to learn and collaborate.

Open Question (Nomination): A key question such as: "Which colleague would you go to if you had a question about a new technological tool and why?" This question will be essential for the influence analysis.

Phase 2: Data Collection

The survey will be distributed to all DYCSI employees through internal communication channels.

A clear response timeframe (e.g., 5 business days) will be established to ensure a high participation rate. Individual responses will be kept confidential to encourage honesty.

Phase 3: Machine Learning Model Development

The data collected in Google Sheets will be exported to a .csv format.

The data will be cleaned and preprocessed to convert it into numerical features that the model can understand.

A Logistic Regression model will be trained. The target variable (what we want to predict) will be whether an employee is an "ideal candidate" or not. This label will be created from a combination of factors: high self-assessment of initiative, being recommended by other colleagues, and explicitly expressing interest.

The model will learn the patterns that define an ideal candidate based on the survey data.

Phase 4: Analysis, Selection, and Reporting

The trained model will assign a "suitability score" to each employee.

The AI Consultant Interns team will analyze these results, combining the quantitative scoring of the model with a qualitative analysis of the open-ended responses (the reasons for the nominations).

A final report will be generated with the list of recommended candidates, the methodology used, and the insights obtained. This report will be presented to the CEO for final selection and next steps.

5. Profile of the "AI Pioneer" (Selection Criteria)
We are looking for collaborators who demonstrate:

Empathy and Charisma: Ability to connect with others and build trust. They are people others listen to.

Positive Influence: Their opinions are respected, and they are often recommended by their peers.

Initiative and Proactivity: They don't wait to be asked to do things; they actively seek out new ways to improve.

Openness and Curiosity: They show a genuine interest in learning and experimenting with new technologies, without fear of making mistakes.

Communication Skills: They can explain potential issues.
